## Preface

Don't buy the lie that you should only learn and use a small collection of *good parts* while avoiding all the bad stuff. 



## What is Scope?

一般的程式語言都擁有儲存變數的功能，並且可以事後取得或修改，如果沒有這樣的機制，一樣可以執行一些任務，但就會有其限制性存在。



於是相應的問題出現，這些變數要存在在哪？更重要的是，當 program 需要這些變數的時候要如何找到它們？



These questions speak to the need for a well-defined set of rules for storing variables in some location, and for finding those variables at a later time. We'll call that set of rules: *Scope*.



### Compiler Theory

1. **Tokenizing/Lexing:**

   `var a = 2;`. This program would likely be broken up into the following tokens: `var`, `a`, `=`, `2`, and `;`

2. **Parsing**
